Energetic consumption forecasting
A large regional residential developer is designing a large 'Smart Home' apartment housing development and is looking for evidence or positive reasons for adopting the use of electrical sub-metering devices used for power management in Smart Homes.

Installing these sub-meters could be a big step towards the developer's goal of offering highly efficient Smart Homes that provide owners with power usage analytics - a large piece of their planned marketing efforts.

We have been asked to find enough evidence to help support the developer's marketing claims of sub-meters providing owners with 'useful' power usage analytics; we need to do this by performing an 'analytical deep dive' of sub-metering generated data and producing high quality visualizations that support a positive narrative or story around your findings.  

We have also been asked to demonstrate that we can predict future energy consumption from the same data; this would help further support their adoption of sub-meters from the viewpoint of possible energy consumption reduction and a monetary savings as a result.
